======

Orrery is a planetary system simulator.  With it, you can specify stellar and planetary parameters and watch your system evolve over time.  

Users can add a star to their system, and specify its parameters - mass, radius, luminosity, et cetera.  Once their star is in place, they begin to add planets.  Planets and orbits are also customizable, from mass to orbital ellipticity.  After a system is set up, users can view reports on their system.  Light curve plots and a map of the system are available to the user.  The application can be used to validate a theoretical expolanetary model or compare measured light curves with different models to compare fit.


Stars
-----
Stars in Orrery are represented by only a few parameters:
* Stellar mass
* Stellar radius
* Stellar luminosity

This is not a perfect representation of all stars, but it is a close enough approximation for our purposes.

Potential future goals - multiple star systems, modeling limb darkening.


Planets
-------
Planets in Orrery are represented by the following parameters:
* Planetary mass
* Planetary radius
* Orbital radius
* Orbital period
* Orbital inclination (translation up/down)
* Orbital elevation (rotation about center)
* Orbital ellipticity
* Orbital ellipse rotation
* Orbital phase (where the planet is with respect to other planets in the system)

Currently Orrery only supports one planet, so many of these are moot.  This list also does not include every factor that may affect the system, but the goal is a reasonable simulation, not perfect physical replication.

Potential future goals - moons around planets, simulate planet/star and planet/planet gravitational interaction


Reporting
---------
Orrery assumes the system is a very large distance away from the observer.  A plot of the observed light curve and map of the current state of the system is shown in the main window.

Potential future goals - export light curve to a file, live reports for each planet



Changelog
---------
_v0.0.1_
* Added initial features





_v0.1 goals_
* Simulate a 1-star, 1-planet system
* Draw a map of the system, i.e. a picture of the planet going around the star
* Draw a plot of the light curve, i.e. the flux observed by a very distant telescope
* Approximations weâ€™re okay with:
* Star only has solar radius - no mass, luminosity yet
* Planet only has planetary radius and orbital period
* Orbit is on zero inclination
* Orbit is perfectly circular
* No partial eclipses - planet is either 0% or 100% occulting the star
